# Tutorials for pointcloud processing in Python

The use of pointclouds tends to increase over the years, as 3D acquisition and 3D modeling systems and software become more widely available. Pointclouds are nowadays used in many areas, such as computer-aided design, metrology, extended reality, robotics, and autonomous driving, to name just a few.

These tutorials have been created for those wishing to learn a little bit more about the basics of pointcloud processing. Having gone through this stage during my Ph.D., I hope here to share some of what I've learned.

These tutorials have been designed to make pointcloud processing algorithms easier to understand, and to minimize the use of specialized third-party software. They require basic knowledge of Python and its main scientific libraries.

## Content

Tutorials are broken down as follows:

1. Basic operations
2. Spatial indexing (TBD)
3. Registration (TBD)
4. Segmentation (TBD)
5. Primitive fitting (TBD)

## Dependencies

The code is in `python` and relies on `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib`.

## Going further

The list does not pretend to be not exhaustive but may be a good starting point to go deeper in the topic of pointcloud processing.
